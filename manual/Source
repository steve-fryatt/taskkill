Introduction
------------

TaskKill is a small BASIC utility that allows you to kill Wimp tasks from
the Command line.


Installing and Using TaskKill
-----------------------------

TaskKill requires RISC OS 3 or later.  It can be run off a hard disc or
floppy disc (but is probably useless off floppy).

To install TaskKill, copy it into your library (or anywhere on <Run$Path>).
On a RiscPC or later, this may be !Boot.Library unless you have made other
arrangements.

It is now possible to type *TaskKill <taskname> from the command line to
kill the corresponding task.  <taskname> is the name listed in the task
Manager window (is the name contains spaces, include it in double quotes:
"Impression Publisher").
