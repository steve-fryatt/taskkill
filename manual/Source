<chapter title="Introduction" file="Intro">

<cite>TaskKill</cite> is a small BASIC utility that allows you to kill Wimp tasks from the Command line.

</chapter>





<chapter title="Installing and Using TaskKill" file="Use">

<cite>TaskKill</cite> requires RISC&nbsp;OS&nbsp;3 or later. It can be run off a hard disc or floppy disc (but is probably useless off floppy).

To install <cite>TaskKill</cite>, copy it into your library (or anywhere on &lt;Run$Path&gt;). On a RiscPC or later, this may be <file>!Boot.Library</file> unless you have made other arrangements.

It is now possible to type <command>*TaskKill &lt;taskname&gt;</command> from the command line to kill the corresponding task. &lt;taskname&gt; is the name listed in the Task Manager window (if the name contains spaces, include it in double quotes: &quot;Impression Publisher&quot;).
